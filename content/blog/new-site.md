I have been working on giving a refresh of the Vult site. The result is what you see now. After trying a few alternatives I settle to use Hugo (https://gohugo.io). The reason I used Hugo was because I could make it do exactly what I wanted with the help of the documentation.

I'm very proud that I did the theme of the site from the ground up (that's why is so minimalistic). I also added comments section using Google+, and I hope it works as expected.
